This Unity project was created by me in its entirety

This game is a small shooting range. The player can walk around a small playable area. There are some buttons that the player can shoot to change the difficulty and a start button. Shooting the start button causes a number of targets to appear one after another. The goal for the player is to shoot the targets as many times as possible to get a high score. 5 targets will spawn, at which point the player must shoot the start button again to try again, which resets their score.

Controls:
- WASD - Move
- M1 (Left click) - Shoot

This project demonstrates use of the following design patterns: Singleton, Observer, Command, Factory.
